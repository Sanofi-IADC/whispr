We created it to meet our need for a centralised comment and alerting service which could be easily integrated into our tech stack.</p><p>In Whispr each event object is called a whisp. A whisp is classified with a severity level from info to critical, can have tags to further classify it, and has a generic data object which stores the detail of the whisp. As an example, a comment within an application could be a whisp of severity level info, with the comment text in the data object.</p><p>Using Whispr we\u2019ve implemented a messaging service for users to communicate between our apps, and a business process status pub/sub alerting solution - any system can send an alert to Whispr, and susbscribing applications and users are automatically notified to display the alert and take action.</p><h2 id="main-features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#main-features" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Main features</h2><ul><li>GraphQL and REST API for whisp creation</li><li>Whisp classification through severity types</li><li>Filtering using any of the base elements of a whisp</li><li>Tag management system for whisp classification</li><li>Subscriptions through GraphQL with Websockets (more subscription types coming up very soon in our roadmap)</li></ul><h2 id="example-use-cases-for-whispr" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example-use-cases-for-whispr" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Example use cases for Whispr</h2><ul><li>Equipment status sharing (alerting) from IoT equipment</li><li>Lightweight comment feed (messaging) solutions</li><li>Machine learning on a central hub of data to identify data trends (common root causes for alerts, alert patterns)</li></ul><h3 id="whispr-in-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#whispr-in-action" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Whispr in action</h3><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="Chat application with whispr animated gif" title="Chat with whispr"></p><p><em>Demonstration of using whispr as a comment system.
